# Surfwives Forecast — Weekly Picker (Mobile‑friendly)

This build adds:
- **Swipeable calendar** on phones (snap‑to‑day columns)
- **Sticky Forecast bar** at the bottom (with safe‑area)
- **Controls collapsed** by default on mobile
- **Per‑day cards** kept as a section, **collapsed by default**; horizontal scroll on phones
- Larger tap targets (prevents iOS zoom)

Footer line: “All heuristics are for fun. Double-check cams and local knowledge (Martin and Noah's opinions).”

## Deploy
Upload/replace `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, `manifest.webmanifest`, and `README.md` → commit to `main` → refresh your Pages site.

## Tip
If a spot returns “No hourly data,” nudge longitude ~0.01–0.02° **west** (slightly offshore). Tide can fail; waves/wind still score.
