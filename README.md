# Surfwives Forecast — Weekly Picker (Full Mobile Build)

**What you get**
- Correct Open‑Meteo endpoints (marine waves, forecast wind, optional tide)
- Calendar matrix (columns = days, rows = spots) with rank + Avg AM score
- Mobile‑friendly: calendar turns into swipeable day panels with snap
- Per‑day cards section kept, collapsed by default (and swipeable on mobile)
- Sticky Forecast bar on phones, larger tap targets, safe‑area padding
- Title + footer text as requested

**Deploy**
Upload/replace `index.html`, `style.css`, `app.js`, and this `README.md` in your repo root. Commit to `main`. Hard refresh your site.

**Notes**
- Tide can be missing; scoring continues.
- If you see no data for a custom spot, nudge longitude 0.01–0.02° west to sit offshore.


**Change:** Crowd sensitivity slider now defaults to **Off**.
