# Surfwives Forecast — Weekly Picker

This version adds a **Calendar view** (columns = next 7 days, rows = your spots), showing **daily rank + Avg AM score** in each cell. The original **Per‑day cards** are still there, now collapsed by default.

Also updated title: **🏄‍♂ 🏳️‍🌈 Surfwives Forecast — Weekly Picker**  
Footer: “All heuristics are for fun. Double-check cams and local knowledge (Martin and Noah's opinions).”
